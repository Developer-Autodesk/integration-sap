##Description

*This sample is part of the [Developer-Autodesk/Autodesk-View-and-Data-API-Samples](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/autodesk-view-and-data-api-samples) repository.*

An ASP.Net MVC website sample that integrates the Autodesk View and Data API with an SAP database using the [SAP Gateway for Microsoft (GWM)](http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-47563) technology. The sample demonstrates:
* Displaying data from an SAP database in a custom panel when a model element is selected.
* Selecting a model element when an item in a separate tree view is clicked.
* Updating an SAP data item and redisplaying the data in the model.

##Dependencies

This sample has a dependency on [Developer-Autodesk/library-dotnet](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/library-dotnet). You will also need access to an SAP database and SAP GWM.
